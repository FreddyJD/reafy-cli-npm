Deploy easily your **react-app** to the cloud. The main difference between Reafy, and other providers is that we dont move your application to cold-storage when your app stop getting traffic. 

We encourage you to start using multiple providers. Make your back-end with Heroku or Zeit, and connect them with your Reafy front-end through your cool API.

To install the latest version of Reafy CLI run this command:


```

npm i reafy -g

```

  

How to deploy your app:

  

```

npm run build # Build your static app.

rea # Boom! deploy your app.

```

Dev note: We support any SPA with client-side rendering. So yes! **Angular and Vue** are welcome!. just build it and rename your **dist** folder **build**.
